# --count

The `--count` flag displays **the number of files and directories** inside each folder in the tree.  
This makes it easy to see folder contents at a glance without expanding everything.

---

## Usage
```
show-file-tree  --count
```

---

## Example

### Without `--count`

```text
├── 📁 docs
│   └── readme.md
├── 📁 src
│   └── main.py
└── LICENSE
```

### With `--count`

```text
├── 📁 docs (3f, 2d)
│   └── readme.md
├── 📁 src (5f, 1d)
└── LICENSE
```

**Legend:**

* `3f` = 3 files
* `2d` = 2 subdirectories

---

## Tip

Combine `--count` with other display flags:

```
show-file-tree  --count --size --theme monokai
```

This shows folder counts, file sizes, and a colored theme in one view.

---

## Why it’s useful

* Quickly assess folder contents without opening directories.
* Helpful in **documentation**, **code reviews**, or **project analysis**.
* Works well with `--max-depth` for summarized folder overviews.
