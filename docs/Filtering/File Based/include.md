## :material-fountain-pen-tip: Tips

!!! tip

    - Multiple `--include` flags can be combined to include several file types.
    - Combine with `--exclude` to **refine filtering**:
        ```bash title="Filtering"
        show-file-tree  --include "*.py" --exclude "tests/*"
        ```
    - Works with `--format md` to generate **filtered Markdown documentation**.
