## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is a **CLI tool for displaying file/folder trees**.  
It does **not process sensitive data** or connect to external services.  
Therefore, the security risk surface is minimal.

If you believe you have found a security-related issue (e.g., command injection, unsafe file handling), please report it by **opening a GitHub Issue** in this repository.

We will review and address it as quickly as possible.
